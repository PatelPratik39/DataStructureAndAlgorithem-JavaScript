1. What is Hashtable?
    - Hash table is a data structure that allows for effecient data retrival, insertion, delete operation.
    - Hash Table uses a technique called hashing to mapkeys to associate values.

2. What is Collisions: in HashTable?
    - A collection in Hahstable when a value has assigned 2 keys that time collesion occure.

3. How to handler Collition in Hahstable?
    - there are 2 ways to handle Collision in hashTable :  Chaining, Open Addressing
        * Chaining : Each bucket is a linked list or another data structure where multiple key-value pairs can be stored.
        * Open Addressing :  When a collision occurs, the hashtable probes for the next available bucket to store the key-value pair. 
                        Techniques include linear probing, quadratic probing, and double hashing.

# Hash Table Operation:

# Insertion: 
    - Calculate the hash code of the key using hash function.
    - User the Hash code to find the index in the array
    - if the bucket is empty, store thet key-value pair.
    - if the bucket is occupied, handle the collision
# Search
    - Calculate the hash code of the key using hash function.
    - User the Hash code to find the index in the array
    - If the bucket is empty, the key is not in the hashtable.
    - If the bucket is not empty, search through the linked list or data structure in the bucket to find the key.

# Deletion
    - If the bucket is empty, the key is not in the hashtable.
    - If the bucket is not empty, search through the linked list or data structure in the bucket to find the key and remove it.
